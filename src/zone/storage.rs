//! Storing zone data.
//!
//! This module integrates the [`cascade_zonedata`] subcrate with the main
//! daemon. It imports [`ZoneDataStorage`], the core state machine for tracking
//! zone data, and adds helpers around it to simplify common transitions.
//!
//! Zone data storage consists of the following components:
//!
//! - The *current loaded instance*.
//! - The *current signed instance*.
//! - An *upcoming loaded instance*.
//! - An *upcoming signed instance*.
//!
//! The *current* instances have been approved and published. The *upcoming*
//! instances are being built and reviewed; once they are (both!) approved, they
//! will replace the current instances. Each instance is either read-locked (so
//! it can be served or reviewed) or write-locked (so it can be built into).
//! [`ZoneDataStorage`] is a state machine for manipulating instances.
//!
//! The zone data storage is *passive* or *busy*. In passive state, no instances
//! of the zone are being built, so new operations (e.g. loading and re-signing)
//! can be initiated. In busy state, an instance of the zone is being built, and
//! such operations must wait. When the data storage becomes passive, it will
//! call [`StorageZoneHandle::on_passive()`] to initiate enqueued operations.
